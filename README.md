# Virtual-Art-Gallery
In my sophomore year, I conceptualized and developed an innovative website project that seamlessly integrates JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, and SQL databases to create an immersive platform known as "Museo".
This Virtual Art Gallery is a sophisticated online platform designed to cater to individuals who seek the convenience of exploring and appreciating artworks from the comfort of their homes. This comprehensive project encompasses a dynamic fusion of front-end and back-end technologies, providing users with an engaging and user-friendly experience.
